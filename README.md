# UnityTest
Dear candidate,

Before you clone the project with the test make sure you have Unity3D 2019.4.1f1. Once you complete the test, publish your branch or repo for us to review your solution.
The test itself is at **/Assets/Tests/HandlerTester.cs**. The file you need to work on is at **/Assets/Scripts/SimulatorHandler.cs**

Bests,
Amrullah Mishelov (thedrhax14).
